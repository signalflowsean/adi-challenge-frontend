# Walk of the 10 Producers
## What is this?
This is a data visualization application (using React, TS, & d3.js) that consumes (via websocket) and displays data in real time from 10 producers. Each producer generates a random walk timeseries dataset at a rate of 1000 data points per second. This repo is just for the frontend - here is a [link](https://github.com/6xzo/challenge-backend) to the corresponding backend.
